# Design and Implementation of an Automated Sorting System Using Mechatronics Principle
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Design and Implementation of an Automated Sorting System Using Mechatronics Principle.
ABSTRACT: This project implements an automated color-based object sorting system using a Raspberry Pi, stepper and servo motors, an IR sensor, and OpenCV for computer vision. The system detects objects on a conveyor belt via an IR sensor, captures their images, and processes them in real-time to identify colors (Red, Green, Blue). Based on the detected color, servo motors actuate to sort items into designated bins. The workflow integrates multi-threading for concurrent motor control and image processing, ensuring efficiency. Key technologies include Raspberry Pi GPIO, PWM-based servo control, HSV color masking, and contour detection. The system demonstrates embedded automation with applications in industrial sorting, recycling, and smart warehousing.
Keywords: Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, Stepper Motor, Servo Control, Color Detection, Automation.
